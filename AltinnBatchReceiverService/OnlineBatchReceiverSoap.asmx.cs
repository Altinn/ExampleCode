    /// This is a sample implementation of Altinn Service Receive. It receives messages and perform these steps:
    /// 1) Authenticate with username and password (just a placeholder in this sample code)
    /// 2) Verifies the Xml Batch Data vs. the Batch schema XSD file
    /// 3) Receives the message, in this example code it is saved to file, but in real solution it may pushed to MSMQ, saved to DB, sent to web service (async) or otherwise processed.
    /// 
    /// This strategy is chosen on return:
    /// 
    /// FAILED:                 When the message was not persisted. The same principle could apply for messages not saed to DB, not sent to MSMQ, failure on sending to an internal REST endpoint etc.
    ///                         The message will be resent by Altinn after a configured (default 30 seconds) time.
    ///                         This means that the message may have been received, but we could persist it or pass it on internally.
    ///                         We also set FAILED when the data load (batch) do not verify vs. schema. After 3 retries, Altinn will stop sending messages and the issue with the Schema must be corrected.
    /// 
    /// FAILED_DO_NOT_RETRY:    When the message was a duplicate. This is detected when saved to file. When other implementations are chosed such as MSMQ there should be some mechanism to detect
    ///                         that a message has been received.
    /// 
    /// Regarding point 3: 
    /// It is important to handle the reception of the message in such a way that we quickly return the result to Altinn.
    /// This means that further processing should be asynchronous with the message reception.
    /// Further processing may be done by either pulling files from the Inbox directory (using directory monitoring), pulling from MSMQ, receive an Synch stream on a REST service, pussing data from DB etc.
    /// 
    /// Regarding Schema validation strategy:
    /// We have chosen to validate the Batch schema only as this is within Altinn's responsibility.
    /// The question is: should the Request Schema also be verified (the actual data from end user).
    /// This should not be done here as part of receiving the data as it is not within Altinn's responsibility.
    /// However, we suggest that this is first step of the further (asynchronous) processing of the message.
    /// 
    /// We also validate the response schema. We suggest this is done only during development and testing, and be removed before production setting.
    /// 
    /// Regarding Logging:
    /// We have chosen a very simple logging to file in this sample code, using a Semaphore to control concurrency. The configuration contain log file limit. When log file limit is reached, it is copied and
    /// a new empty log file is created. It also logs to the Application Event Log. The real service implementation may perfectly well use this approach, but may also choose other approaches such as:
    /// * Only logging to Event Log
    /// * Using NLog
    /// 
    /// Regarding Security: 
    /// This sample service implementation does not contain any transportation or policy security, this must be implemented by the service owner.
    /// 
    /// Regarding the actual Schema Data:
    /// It would be an idea to validate the incoming data vs. the schema. This Schema is known by the Service Owner.
